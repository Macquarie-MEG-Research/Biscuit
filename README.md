GUI to convert KIT MEG data to BIDS format

At the moment just a simple GUI that can visualise a folder structure and allow the data contained within to be converted to the BIDS format.

I'll write more here later...

mne-bids is included here for now as I have made a number of changes to the library that will hopefully at some point be accepted into it officialy.
For now it needs to be included explicitly here.
