## Description
Biscuit is a simple graphical application that facilitates the reformatting of raw KIT and Elekta MEG data to comply with the international [BIDS Standard](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/).
Current discussion on the BIDS specification can be found [here](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification).

Biscuit requires at least Python 3.4, but it is recommended to have [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-367/) or [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/)

For full installation and usage instructions visit the [Biscuit GitHub page](https://macquarie-meg-research.github.io/Biscuit/)

Biscuit uses [MNE-Python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python) and [MNE-BIDS](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-bids) to load the MEG data and convert to BIDS format.
