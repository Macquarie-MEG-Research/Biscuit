## What is Biscuit?
Biscuit is a simple graphical application that facilitates the reformatting of raw KIT and Elekta MEG data to comply with the international [BIDS specification](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification).

Biscuit utilises the power of [MNE](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html) and [MNE-BIDS](https://mne-tools.github.io/mne-bids/) to perform the conversion.

Biscuit developed with the support of [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/).
