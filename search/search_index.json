Because of this all the information required to be added can be entered on one single file. FIF file window There are a number of fields that need to be completed before the .fif file is ready for conversion. Experimental information Required information Project Name : ID of the project. This should match the project ID specified in the project settings so that any default values can be applied automatically. Session ID : Session number with the particular participant. Task : A shorthand identifier for the task performed. Run : An integer identifier for the run or block number (often just 1 , 2 etc.). Subject information Subject ID : The ID used to identify the participant in a confidential manner. Subject DOB : The date of birth of the participant. This is entered in dd/mm/yyy format (sorry America!). Subject Gender : One of M (Male), F (Female), U (Unknown). Subject Group : The group within the study the participant belongs to. THe default values are Participant and Control , however these can be set in the project default settings .

You should only select one empty room recoring per day otherwise any other existing empty room recording will be overwritten by the new one. Has empty room : If this is selected the BIDS data will contain a path pointing to the location of empty room file from the same recording day. Note that there is not check on whether or not this empty room file actually exists as this data can be produced after the BIDS conversion occurs for this file. If you do not have any empty room data that was taken on the same day as this con file, do not check this box as the data will not be correct. Channel name overrides As Elekta data can contain BIO channels which can contain data from EMG , ECG or EOG sources we need some way to specify the data on these channels. Currently the channel names section will display all channels that have the BIO type. You can rename the channel if you wish, and also specify the type of data on the channel so that the BIDS conversion process can correctly output the right channel type. Exporting the data When all the required information has been entered, the Generate BIDS button will become active. To export you simply press this button once and a popup will appear which gives the current progress of the export process.

Upon running the script you will be greeting with two pop-ups. The first pop-up will ask you to select the location of your MEG data. You need to select the parent folder that contains all of your MEG data, instead of a single folder which contains data from one session. For example, if you have a folder set up like Main folder \u2514 Elekta Data \u2514 Proj1 - file1.fif - file2.fif \u2514 Proj2 - file1.fif \u2514 KIT Data \u2514 Proj1 - file.con - file.mrk ... then you want to select the Main folder as all the sub folders will be able to be navigated to within Biscuit. You shouldn't ever need to or want to change this directory as this can render any of Biscuit's save data incompatible. Main window Selecting a folder as shown will bring up the Folder Info tab where you can enter important info about the recording session. In general, if a field is red, it is required for conversion to BIDS format, and the process won't be allowed until a session has no red fields remaining. Settings windows To make the BIDS conversion process as quick and easy as possible, Biscuit is able to store the settings for any projects you have to reduce the amount of information needed to be entered. Each project has it's own settings, so any file that is given the specified project number will automatically have these settings applied to it. Project settings list To add new settings or edit existing settings select Options > Set Defaults from the menu. The first time you run Biscuit you will be greeted with an empty list of project settings. This view displays some condensed information about the project so that you can see quickly what the important current settings are. To add settings for a new project select the Add Row button. Add new project settings The new project settings popup allows for a fair bit of information to be entered. It is worth spending some time to enter in any project information here as the information is applied to all relevant data. Entry field descriptions Project Title : A short title for your project. This will be placed in the readme generated. Project ID : This is the ID of your project. Generally this will be an alphanumeric identifier that all experiments within a test will share. It is this value that tells Biscuit what experimental data should be using the project settings. Start/End Date : Starting and finishing dates of the project. These are not required but are good to provide for record keeping. If the end date is unknown it can be left blank. Project Description : A free-form field where you can enter any information about the project. As much information about the project should be included here as possible as this is the only place where you can put whatever you want. Trigger Channels : This is a list where you can add as many trigger channels as you require. For each row you enter the channel number and the description of the event on this channel. This information will automatically be displayed in the channels tab where extra channels can be added if particular runs use more or less trigger channels than the default settings. Participant Groups : A list of all the participant groups within the project. The default values for any project are Participant and Control . If you wish to have groups different to these values you can simply add as many groups as you require and these will appear in the Subject info entry area for the experimental data.

The left side consists of a file treeview which is used to navigate the directories containing all the various files. Selecting any file will bring up information if there is info available. Most files that are not used for MEG will simply have the message that the data type is not supported. Some human-readble text files will be displayed however. This includes MATLAB .m files, Python .py scripts and .txt files. Both .py and .m files also support syntax highlighting (requires the pygments python library) The right side displays all the file information for the selected file. This view is a tabbed which .con and .fif files utilise to gain a Channels and Events tab respectively. Biscuit is BIDS aware Once a some data has been converted into BIDS format it will appear in a subfolder named BIDS-20XX-YY where XX will be the year and YY will be the fortnight number (this can be configured in the settings window if you do not want the export process to check the BIDS data. This is only like this for institutions who may want to back up data regularly). Right-clicking on this folder will bring up a context menu with the option to \"assign as BIDS folder\". Selecting this option will check whether the folder contains data that conforms to the BIDS specification, and if so it will parse some of the data and load it into a data structure. This information can then be seen when selecting the Folder itself, or the subsequent project, subject or session folders. After indicating to Biscuit that a folder contains BIDS compliant data, it can be transferred to an external device by selecting \"sent to...\" from the right click menu of a folder.

It may look like a bit at first, but once you undertsand the process it can be done in a very short amount of time. Because KIT data consists of multiple files unlike Elekta data which consists of a single .fif file, the main object is the parent folder containing the .con , .mrk , .elp , and .hsp files.

If you do not have any empty room data that was taken on the same day as this con file, do not check this box as the data will not be correct. Channel information It is often important to specify if a certain channel is bad, or if a channel has any trigger information on it so that MNE can process this information properly and MNE-BIDS can produce the correct event information on export. If you have set up any default channels when setting up your project defaults , then you will automatically see any channels specified as trigger channels in the channel tab, along with their default trigger description. You can however add any other channel detected in the .con file to add to the list if you need to add extra trigger channels for the particular recording. Associating an .mrk file It is crucial for each .con file to know what .mrk file was used during the recording. We can associate a .con file with an .mrk file in one of 3 different ways, all achieved by right-clicking on the .mrk or .con file in question. Right-click on a .con file and select associate . This will prompt you to select an .mrk file to associate with the .con file. You can do this by right-clicking the .mrk file you wish to associate and then selecting associate .

This will associate the selected .mrk file with every .con file in the same directory. Once an .mrk has been associated with a .con file, selecting a .con file will highlight any associated .mrk files in blue in the file treeview on the left hand side. You can use this to confirm that you have associated the correct .mrk file with the correct .con file. Note that you cannot associate more than 2 .mrk files with any given .con file. If 2 .mrk files are associated with the one .con file you will need to select the .mrk in the file tree and select the acquisition time, which is one of \"n/a\" (used when you have only one .mrk associated with a .con file), 'pre' (indicates the .mrk file was recorded before the raw data was collected), and 'post' (indicating the .mrk file was recorded after the raw data was collected).

To allow for the reading of MEG data and conversion a few libraries are required to be installed. There are a few options available depending on the current python install on your system. > Already have Python installed Biscuit is written for python 3.4 and above, however it is recommended that you use at least the latest version of 3.6 which can be found here . If you already have python installed you can easily install Biscuit from a precompiled wheel. This can be downloaded from the releases tab on github. There are two ways to download and install using this. You can either just copy the link and enter python3 -m pip install https://github.com/Macquarie-MEG-Research/Biscuit/releases/download/v0.9.3/Biscuit-0.9.3-py3-none-any.whl (where the version may vary depending on the current release version), or you can download the wheel ( .whl ) file to your local disk and enter python3 -m pip install Biscuit-0.9.3-py3-none-any.whl into your command line within the directory the downloaded file resides. This wheel is preconfigured to download any prerequisites as well as create an executable in the scripts folder of your python install. On linux you may also require python3-pil.imagetk and python3-tk for the GUI to function. Important: Installing BIDSHanlder Biscuit also requires a library that is not yet on PyPI and thus needs to be installed in a similar fashion as Biscuit. To allow Biscuit to read and handle BIDS folder correctly it uses BIDSHandler . This can be installed in a similar way to Biscuit by going to the releases tab and installing the most recent version. Biscuit should always be compatible with the most recent version, however this method of installation will be replaced with a more stable version of installing for PyPi automatically once BIDSHandler has been added to it. > Don't have Python installed If you do not have a current Python install on your system, you can either install the Anaconda Python distribution. Anaconda is however a reasonably large installation, so you may prefer to simply download Python from the website and install Biscuit using pip as above. This has the benefit of also being faster to install and gives you more control over what is installed. You can also follow the steps to install MNE-Python . Issues with pip If you are installing python 3 and the required libraries on a mac (or on a system with another python install) you may have conflicts with the internal python 2.7 install. To get around this you may need to specify excplitly the version of python the libraries are being install into. Entering python3 --version into a command prompt should show the currently installed version of python 3. If an error is raised, entering python --version should show the current version (>3.4). If neither python3 --version or python --version return a value or error, then Python has not been installed correctly. You may need to ensure that python is installed to the path: Note that you shouldn't have to do this for python version 3.6 and above (but it is good to go though the \"advanced\" settings when installing to ensure that it is indeed added to the path to save any headaches later.) Whichever command ( python or python3 ) is the one which shows the correctly installed version of python > 3.4, can be used to call pip explicitly for that version: python -m pip install <package names> or python3 -m pip install <package names> where <package names> is the list of packages to be installed ( numpy , scipy etc.). Installing and running Biscuit Installing Biscuit from the wheel creates an executable in the python scripts folder ( <python install directory>\\Scripts\\Biscuit.<extension> ). This executable is generally added to the path if you have administrative rights on the computer, so you can either run Biscuit by simply entering Biscuit into a command prompt, or you can create a shortcut to the executable (extension is platform dependent) and run Biscuit like any other executable. If you create a shortcut to the executable and want to have the nice Biscuit icon it can be found at <python install directory>\\Lib\\site-packages\\Biscuit\\assets\\bisc.<ico/png/gif> .","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#installating-prerequisites","text":"Biscuit is completely written in python, allowing it to be run on any computer you can install python on.

You can either just copy the link and enter python3 -m pip install https://github.com/Macquarie-MEG-Research/Biscuit/releases/download/v0.9.3/Biscuit-0.9.3-py3-none-any.whl (where the version may vary depending on the current release version), or you can download the wheel ( .whl ) file to your local disk and enter python3 -m pip install Biscuit-0.9.3-py3-none-any.whl into your command line within the directory the downloaded file resides. This wheel is preconfigured to download any prerequisites as well as create an executable in the scripts folder of your python install. On linux you may also require python3-pil.imagetk and python3-tk for the GUI to function.","title":"&gt; Already have Python installed"},{"location":"installation/#important-installing-bidshanlder","text":"Biscuit also requires a library that is not yet on PyPI and thus needs to be installed in a similar fashion as Biscuit. To allow Biscuit to read and handle BIDS folder correctly it uses BIDSHandler . This can be installed in a similar way to Biscuit by going to the releases tab and installing the most recent version. Biscuit should always be compatible with the most recent version, however this method of installation will be replaced with a more stable version of installing for PyPi automatically once BIDSHandler has been added to it.","title":"Important: Installing BIDSHanlder"},{"location":"installation/#dont-have-python-installed","text":"If you do not have a current Python install on your system, you can either install the Anaconda Python distribution. Anaconda is however a reasonably large installation, so you may prefer to simply download Python from the website and install Biscuit using pip as above. This has the benefit of also being faster to install and gives you more control over what is installed. You can also follow the steps to install MNE-Python .","title":"&gt; Don't have Python installed"},{"location":"installation/#issues-with-pip","text":"If you are installing python 3 and the required libraries on a mac (or on a system with another python install) you may have conflicts with the internal python 2.7 install. To get around this you may need to specify excplitly the version of python the libraries are being install into. Entering python3 --version into a command prompt should show the currently installed version of python 3. If an error is raised, entering python --version should show the current version (>3.4). If neither python3 --version or python --version return a value or error, then Python has not been installed correctly. You may need to ensure that python is installed to the path: Note that you shouldn't have to do this for python version 3.6 and above (but it is good to go though the \"advanced\" settings when installing to ensure that it is indeed added to the path to save any headaches later.) Whichever command ( python or python3 ) is the one which shows the correctly installed version of python > 3.4, can be used to call pip explicitly for that version: python -m pip install <package names> or python3 -m pip install <package names> where <package names> is the list of packages to be installed ( numpy , scipy etc.).","title":"Issues with pip"},{"location":"installation/#installing-and-running-biscuit","text":"Installing Biscuit from the wheel creates an executable in the python scripts folder ( <python install directory>\\Scripts\\Biscuit.<extension> ). This executable is generally added to the path if you have administrative rights on the computer, so you can either run Biscuit by simply entering Biscuit into a command prompt, or you can create a shortcut to the executable (extension is platform dependent) and run Biscuit like any other executable. If you create a shortcut to the executable and want to have the nice Biscuit icon it can be found at <python install directory>\\Lib\\site-packages\\Biscuit\\assets\\bisc.<ico/png/gif> .","title":"Installing and running Biscuit"}]}
