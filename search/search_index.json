Because of this all the information required to be added can be entered on one single file. FIF file window There are a number of fields that need to be completed before the .fif file is ready for conversion. Experimental information Required information Project Name : ID of the project. This should match the project ID specified in the project settings so that any default values can be applied automatically. Session ID : Session number with the particular participant. Task : A shorthand identifier for the task performed. Run : An integer identifier for the run or block number (often just 1 , 2 etc.). Subject information Subject ID : The ID used to identify the participant in a confidential manner. Subject DOB : The date of birth of the participant. This is entered in dd/mm/yyy format (sorry America!). Subject Gender : One of M (Male), F (Female), U (Unknown). Subject Group : The group within the study the participant belongs to. THe default values are Participant and Control , however these can be set in the project default settings . Optional information Is empty room : If this is selected the file is specified as the empty room data. Empty room data is copied to a different location and named based on the date of the recording. You should only select one empty room recoring per day otherwise any other existing empty room recording will be overwritten by the new one. Has empty room : If this is selected the BIDS data will contain a path pointing to the location of empty room file from the same recording day. Note that there is not check on whether or not this empty room file actually exists as this data can be produced after the BIDS conversion occurs for this file. If you do not have any empty room data that was taken on the same day as this con file, do not check this box as the data will not be correct. Channel name overrides As Elekta data can contain BIO channels which can contain data from EMG , ECG or EOG sources we need some way to specify the data on these channels. Currently the channel names section will display all channels that have the BIO type. You can rename the channel if you wish, and also specify the type of data on the channel so that the BIDS conversion process can correctly output the right channel type. Exporting the data When all the required information has been entered, the Generate BIDS button will become active. To export you simply press this button once and a popup will appear which gives the current progress of the export process. Once the conversion is done the popup will close and the data will available in the BIDS folder that will be in the file view.","title":"Elekta data"},{"location":"guide_elekta/#converting-elekta-data","text":"Data exported from Elekta MEG machines is stored entirely in a single .fif file per run.

Add new project settings If it is your first time using Biscuit to convert some MEG data, you must ensure that the first thing you do before trying to convert any data is to enter the default project settings for your project. This will allow Biscuit to automatically assign a number of values which saves a lot of time for yourself and can lead to almost automatic exporting, requiring only a few values to be selected. To add new project settings you can follow the guide here . It is recommended that you add these settings as soon as you know what they are so that when you take some measurements and open Biscuit for file conversion the data is already added and you do not need to worry about adding them then. Don't worry if you mess up the settings, they can be changed later and the old file will be overwritten with the new settings. Exporting data to a BIDS compliant folder Next, select the folder on the left-hand side that contains the newly acquired data. If you have acquired data using a Yokogawa/KIT system, you can proceed to follow the guide specifically for this data here . If you have acquired data using an Elekta system, the specific guide can be found here . Copying data off computer (if required) The BIDS-compliant data exported by Biscuit will be placed in a sub-folder of a folder named BIDS . Depending on your settings it will most likely be placed in a folder named BIDS-XX where XX is a number. This is to chunk the data so if Biscuit is used on a computer where large amounts of data is being generated, finding the most recent data is easy for those who may need to back up the data. To transfer the data off one computer and onto another the easiest way is to use Biscuit's built in file-transfer abilities. This is recommended because it is able to transfer the data in a way that is 'BIDS-safe'. This means that you can transfer the data to another folder containing BIDS-compliant data and the new data will be merged automatically into the file hierarchy. Transferring your BIDS-compliant data is as easy as selecting the folder you want to transfer, right-click the folder name in the built-in file browser, then selecting 'Send to...'. This will display a pop-up which will let you select the location to transfer your files. It is highly recommnded that you select the same folder every time you do this. This is most easily achieved by using an external HDD and having a folder on it called BIDS (for example). Every time you transfer data off the computer using Biscuit, transfer to this BIDS folder and it will always contain the entire BIDS folder structure of your data. Note : If you do not see the 'Send to...' option the folder hasn't been specified as a folder containing BIDS formatted data. You can fix this by right-clicking the BIDS_XX folder and selecting 'Assign as BIDS folder'. Finishing up Now that your data has been \"BIDSified\", you have an easy to search folder containing all the data from your various experiments. In the future Biscuit will be able to be used to search this data so that specific tests or recordings can be found easily to allow for easy identification for analysis purposes.","title":"First-time use"},{"location":"guide_first_time/#first-time-use-guide","text":"At first glance Biscuit may look a little bit daunting to use, but once you are familiar with how it works it is very simple and fast to use.","title":"First-time use guide"},{"location":"guide_first_time/#add-new-project-settings","text":"If it is your first time using Biscuit to convert some MEG data, you must ensure that the first thing you do before trying to convert any data is to enter the default project settings for your project.

Upon running the script you will be greeting with two pop-ups. The first pop-up will ask you to select the location of your MEG data. You need to select the parent folder that contains all of your MEG data, instead of a single folder which contains data from one session. For example, if you have a folder set up like Main folder \u2514 Elekta Data \u2514 Proj1 - file1.fif - file2.fif \u2514 Proj2 - file1.fif \u2514 KIT Data \u2514 Proj1 - file.con - file.mrk ... then you want to select the Main folder as all the sub folders will be able to be navigated to within Biscuit. You shouldn't ever need to or want to change this directory as this can render any of Biscuit's save data incompatible. Main window Selecting a folder as shown will bring up the Folder Info tab where you can enter important info about the recording session. In general, if a field is red, it is required for conversion to BIDS format, and the process won't be allowed until a session has no red fields remaining. Settings windows To make the BIDS conversion process as quick and easy as possible, Biscuit is able to store the settings for any projects you have to reduce the amount of information needed to be entered. Each project has it's own settings, so any file that is given the specified project number will automatically have these settings applied to it. For a detailed guide on how to add new project settings click here . General navigation Biscuit is split in two halves. The left side consists of a file treeview which is used to navigate the directories containing all the various files. Selecting any file will bring up information if there is info available. Most files that are not used for MEG will simply have the message that the data type is not supported. Some human-readble text files will be displayed however. This includes MATLAB .m files, Python .py scripts and .txt files. Both .py and .m files also support syntax highlighting (requires the pygments python library) The right side displays all the file information for the selected file. This view is a tabbed which .con and .fif files utilise to gain a Channels and Events tab respectively. Biscuit is BIDS aware Once a some data has been converted into BIDS format it will appear in a subfolder named BIDS-20XX-YY where XX will be the year and YY will be the fortnight number (this can be configured in the settings window if you do not want the export process to check the BIDS data. This is only like this for institutions who may want to back up data regularly). Right-clicking on this folder will bring up a context menu with the option to \"assign as BIDS folder\". Selecting this option will check whether the folder contains data that conforms to the BIDS specification, and if so it will parse some of the data and load it into a data structure. This information can then be seen when selecting the Folder itself, or the subsequent project, subject or session folders. Once a folder is recognised to be a BIDS folder, a number of new options become available. Firstly it is possible to search for data within the BIDS folder. Multiple search terms may be chained together, and clicking the result automatically opens up the location in the file tree that the project/subject/session/scan resides in. Secondly it is possible to transfer the BIDS data to another location by using the \"send to...\" context menu option. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you use this method to transfer data to another location as it will retain any BIDS data including automatically transferring any associated empty room data.","title":"General use"},{"location":"guide_general/#general-usage","text":"Biscuit can be run by running the GUI.py file with Python.

It may look like a bit at first, but once you undertsand the process it can be done in a very short amount of time. Because KIT data consists of multiple files unlike Elekta data which consists of a single .fif file, the main object is the parent folder containing the .con , .mrk , .elp , and .hsp files. KIT data folder When you first click on a folder containing all the required files the info panel will be populated with a number of info boxes and entires: If you however select a folder which doesn't contain all the required files, the information panel will inform you of this We require some information to be filled out on this screen: Required information Project Name : ID of the project. This should match the project ID specified in the project settings so that any default values can be applied automatically. Session ID : Session number with the particular participant. Subject information Subject ID : The ID used to identify the participant in a confidential manner. Subject DOB : The date of birth of the participant. This is entered in dd/mm/yyy format (sorry America!). Subject Gender : One of M (Male), F (Female), U (Unknown). Subject Group : The group within the study the participant belongs to. THe default values are Participant and Control , however these can be set in the project default settings . Other information Dewar Position : How the Dewar is positioned. You have a choice of supine or upright . Before the Generate BIDS can become active all child .con files must appear green in the file treeview to indicate they have been all the required information (or are junk in some cases). See the following section on how to prepare each .con file. .CON file window The .con file is the primary building block of KIT data and as such eash one requires a reasonable amount of information for BIDS conversion to happen. Experimental information Required information Task : A shorthand identifier for the task performed. Run : An integer identifier for the run or block number (often just 1 , 2 etc.). Associated .mrk's : A list of any .mrk files that are associated with this .con file. Details on how to do this here Optional information Ignore : This indicates that the .con file isn't needed as part of the data set. The file will not be copied to the BIDS folder. Is empty room : If this is selected the file is specified as the empty room data. Empty room data is copied to a different location and named based on the date of the recording. You should only select one empty room recoring per day otherwise any other existing empty room recording will be overwritten by the new one. Has empty room : If this is selected the BIDS data will contain a path pointing to the location of empty room file from the same recording day. Note that there is not check on whether or not this empty room file actually exists as this data can be produced after the BIDS conversion occurs for this file. If you do not have any empty room data that was taken on the same day as this con file, do not check this box as the data will not be correct. Channel information It is often important to specify if a certain channel is bad, or if a channel has any trigger information on it so that MNE can process this information properly and MNE-BIDS can produce the correct event information on export. If you have set up any default channels when setting up your project defaults , then you will automatically see any channels specified as trigger channels in the channel tab, along with their default trigger description. You can however add any other channel detected in the .con file to add to the list if you need to add extra trigger channels for the particular recording. Associating an .mrk file It is crucial for each .con file to know what .mrk file was used during the recording. We can associate a .con file with an .mrk file in one of 3 different ways, all achieved by right-clicking on the .mrk or .con file in question. Right-click on a .con file and select associate . This will prompt you to select an .mrk file to associate with the .con file. You can do this by right-clicking the .mrk file you wish to associate and then selecting associate . Right-click on an .mrk file and select associate . Same as above but you select the .con file the .mrk is to be associated with. Right-click on an .mrk file and select associate with all . This will associate the selected .mrk file with every .con file in the same directory. Once an .mrk has been associated with a .con file, selecting a .con file will highlight any associated .mrk files in blue in the file treeview on the left hand side. You can use this to confirm that you have associated the correct .mrk file with the correct .con file. Note that you cannot associate more than 2 .mrk files with any given .con file. If 2 .mrk files are associated with the one .con file you will need to select the .mrk in the file tree and select the acquisition time, which is one of \"n/a\" (used when you have only one .mrk associated with a .con file), 'pre' (indicates the .mrk file was recorded before the raw data was collected), and 'post' (indicating the .mrk file was recorded after the raw data was collected).

It is this value that tells Biscuit what experimental data should be using the project settings. Start/End Date : Starting and finishing dates of the project. These are not required but are good to provide for record keeping. If the end date is unknown it can be left blank.

To allow for the reading of MEG data and conversion a few libraries are required to be installed. If you do not have Python installed already, or only have an older version installed (such as the built-in python 2 on Macs) simply download Python from the official website . There are two different install options for Biscuit: \"Complete\" install If you are only going to be using Python for Biscuit the it is recommended that you download the \"complete\" version. This will automatically install the latest version of Biscuit with all required prerequisites. To install, enter the following into a command prompt: If you can read this, download the file from the link in the dropdown or from the github source release page. \"Standard\" install If you already have a pre-existing python install and do not want any particular packages to be downloaded, or know how to install any prerequisites yourself, the normal install can be installed by entering the following into a command prompt: If you can read this, download the file from the link in the dropdown or from the github source release page. The complete list of prequisites are as follows: numpy , scipy , matplotlib , pandas , Pygments , Pillow , mne (>= 0.17.0) , mne-bids (>= 0.1) *, requests and bidshandler (>= 0.2.1) * see issue below for more. Unlike the complete install, this install will not create an executable to run Biscuit. Current issue with MNE-BIDS Due to Biscuit requiring some newer features included in MNE-BIDS it is required to have the most recent version from GitHub. This can be obtained by downloading and building the most recent version of the master branch, or, if you want it done automatically the update feature in Biscuit is currently able to also install the most recent version from GitHub. To find the update button press 'Info' > 'Credits', then select 'Update' on the pop up. This also allows for easy updating of Biscuit. Note that the auto updater will install the \"complete\" version. Running Biscuit Installing Biscuit from the \"complete\" wheel file ( .whl ) creates an executable in the python scripts folder ( <python install directory>\\Scripts\\Biscuit.<extension> ). This executable is generally added to the path if you have administrative rights on the computer, so you can either run Biscuit by simply entering Biscuit into a command prompt, or you can create a shortcut to the executable (extension is platform dependent) and run Biscuit like any other executable. The easiest way to do this is to simply create a shortcut with the location pointing to Biscuit . If you create a shortcut to the executable and want to have the nice Biscuit icon it can be found at <python install directory>\\Lib\\site-packages\\Biscuit\\assets\\bisc.<ico/png/gif> . If installing from the \"standard\" install, you can create a shortcut with the following path: python -c \"from Biscuit import run;run()\" This will call python and tell it to run Biscuit. Potential issues > 'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command : If you are installing python 3 and the required libraries on a mac (or on a system with another python install) you may have conflicts with the internal python 2.7 install. To get around this you may need to specify excplitly the version of python the libraries are being install into. Entering python3 --version into a command prompt should show the currently installed version of python 3. If an error is raised, entering python --version should show the current version (>3.4). If neither python3 --version or python --version return a value or error, then Python has not been installed correctly. You may need to ensure that python is installed to the path. Select 'Add PythonX.Y to PATH' option: Note that you shouldn't have to do this for python version 3.6 and above (but it is good to go though the \"advanced\" settings when installing to ensure that it is indeed added to the path to save any headaches later.) Whichever command ( python or python3 ) is the one which shows the correctly installed version of python > 3.4, can be used to call pip explicitly for that version: python -m pip install <package name(s)> or python3 -m pip install <package name(s)> where <package names> is the list of packages to be installed ( numpy , scipy etc.).","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#installing-biscuit","text":"Biscuit is completely written in Python, allowing it to be run on any computer you can install Python on.
